# League Hiscores
[CAPAA](https://capaa.herokuapp.com) is a Django app that shows you just how boosted<sup>TM</sup> you are.

This scrapes [op.gg](http://na.op.gg/) instead of using the official League of Legends API because Riot's API keys expire every 24 hours and I am not going to generate a new one every day.

Note: as of the beginning of Season 9, none of us play anymore so the script is disabled and the app shows the last recorded standings from Season 8.
